When a repository is initialized, the .git folder is created. This is the first step in tracking changes with Git.

The staging area is the intermediate layer between the working directory and the repository. It allows you to be selective with which files are committed.

I used the staging area to add only one logical change by only adding back the bullet delay.

Branches are useful to test new features etc. without changing the main codebase

Diagramming helps me understand which commits are reachable and which commits exist on which branch.

Merging two branches together compares them to a prior "master" and incorporates all the changes made in both branches.
